title: Opensteno Gamepad Hello World
---
I continued development of [Opensteno Gamepad](https://github.com/openstenotype/opensteno-gamepad) a software to replace the keyboard with a gamepad for GNU/Linux. I got to the point where I have all English letters on the gamepad. And I was able to type a simple hello world with only the gamepad. Including spaces and line breaks.
